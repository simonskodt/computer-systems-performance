# Comparing Joins in DuckDB and SQLite Databases

## A Bit About This Project

This project examines the performance of join operations between DuckDB and SQLite databases. The focus lies on comparing their performance in *OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)* and *OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)* workloads; the comparison utilises queries from the TPC-H benchmark â€” a standard for evaluating database performance.

## OLTP and OLAP

| **OLTP**                          | **OLAP**                          |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Designed for transactional tasks. | Designed for analytical tasks.    |
| Handles a large number of short online transactions (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE). | Handles complex queries for data analysis. |
| Prioritizes speed and reliability. | Prioritizes query performance and insights. |
| Example: Banking systems.         | Example: Business intelligence.  |

| `db_benchmark.py`   | Python script to benchmark query execution times in DuckDB and SQLite databases.     |
| `sql_benchmarks/`   | Contains SQL files for setting up the database schema and running benchmark queries. |
