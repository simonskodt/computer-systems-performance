# Computer Systems Performance

This repository contains assignments for the course Computer Systems Performance.

> [!NOTE]  
> This course focuses on analyzing and improving the performance of data-intensive computer systems. We learn to design performance experiments, use appropriate tools, and understand system layers to troubleshoot and optimize performance. Prior knowledge required: database systems, operating systems, and programming in C/C++.

## Project 01

In [`01_partitioning`](./01_partitioning), the task in this assignment is to reproduce two of the four partitioning algorithms described in the paper titled "Data Partitioning on Chip Multiprocessors." The purpose of the paper is to outline some partitioning strategies that are used in databases to parallelize computation in chip multiprocessors (CMPs).

## Project 02

To-do.
